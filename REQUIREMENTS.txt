Convolutional Neural Networks for Emotion Recognition    GROUP 3



Our developed code work was developed under a Google colaboratory platform
and will need a Google Drive account to be runned.



Once you enter in your Google Drive main menu/desktop, 
you will need to upload que zip file "emotions_dataset.zip" 
and the .py "Grupo 3-CNN for Emotion Recognition" document with the project code.



Make sure that the two document were saved in the main menu.
After that you can open the .py document using the Google Colaboratory.



To run this document, make sure that you choose a compute engine with GPU.
For that you can check/alter the type of machine that you're using in 
the menu "Execution time", in the sub-menu "Change type of execution time".



To run the document by this way, you only need to make sure that all libraries 
are correctly imported and installed. 
To do that, just run the first line code.


Important note: 
			In the second topic "Dataset import and organization" 
you have two cells that only need to be runned in case of you see that the graphics 
that show the dataset disposition have a gap of more than 3000
images between the minority and majority class. If the gap is equal 
or less than 2000 you can proceed.

These graphics are located at four section, topic 
"Dataset pr√©-treatment", sub-topic "Data distribution after imbalance 
treatment".
